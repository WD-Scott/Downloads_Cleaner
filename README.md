# Downloads_Cleaner
Personal project to practice Python skills while building something useful -- a semi-automated way to clean my downloads folder!

# FUTURE UPDATES:
  - Take it one step deeper in Downloads dir structure to create subsubdirs for the most common filetypes
  - Update the scanner.py file so that, when it echos the new files to console they're ordered by filetype
